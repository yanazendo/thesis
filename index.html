<h2>Beer Garden</h2>
<p>Beer Garden defends against high-density attacks by using (1) a <em>Bouncer</em> to kick out frivolous requests, and (2) a <em>Doorman</em> to invert work requests.</p>
<p>Beer Garden is most entertainingly explained through the story of <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#beer-garden','#great-english','the Great English Professor')">the Great English Professor</a>.</p>

<div id='now'>
<h2>Now</h2>
<p>I am using the <a href="https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-bodhisattva-investment-banker-9a23b19f148f">Great Investment Banker</a> algorithm to lead several businesses simultaneously. My currently flahship business is <a href="http://houseofgita.com">House of Gita</a>, but I am also planning to work with the Department of Defense again.</p>
<p>I also have a number of side projects in the works.</p>
</div>

<div id='defense'>
<h2>High-Density Defense</h2>
<p>It is easy to defend against high-density attacks. There are a variety of excellent techniques. In my personal life, I prefer <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#defense','#beer-garden','Beer Garden')">Beer Garden</a>.</p>
<p>The greatest discovery of my research is that the Beer Garden defense is equivalent to <a href="https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-great-zen-professor-71c9ce7cf58d">Zen</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-legendary-jiu-jitsu-master-53d611ef3004">Jiu Jitsu</a>.</p>
<p>I hypothesize that the Beer Garden defense can be used to <a href="https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-bodhisattva-investment-banker-9a23b19f148f">make lots of money while improving the world</a>. I am testing this hypothesis now.</p>
<p>This dissertation represents a high-density defense.</p>
</div>

<div id='apology'>
<h2>Apology</h2>
<p>I sincerely apologize for presenting such an unconventional dissertation. However, this presentation is mutually beneficial because I have engineered it to waste very little of our time. Dissertation is therefore engineered using the principles of <a href="https://medium.com/@yanazendo/enlightened-capitalism-c366cb928a68">mechanism design</a> and <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#apology','#beer-garden','Beer Garden')">Beer Garden</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I claim <a href="http://sidenote.io">Sidenote</a> is great for presenting encyclopedic information, so I feel obligated to use Sidenote as well.</p>

<h2>Principal Accomplishment</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/Annual_Report_2010.pdf">MIT Lincoln Laboratory&#8217;s Annual Report for 2010</a> lists the radar-blackout exercise as the first Principal Accomplishment for the Communication Systems Division on page 20.</p>

<div id='twitter'>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>At Twitter, I worked on the Revenue Risk Team, where we were re-tasked every six months to work on the lastest revenue threat.</p>
<p>There, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/mikegagnon/decl">decl</a>, a declarative programming language that compiled down to <a href="https://github.com/twitter/scalding">Scalding</a>, which made it very easy for me to express and compute the big-data questions I wanted to answer. I used decl on several projects, but the code was &#8220;too sophisticated&#8221; to review. So, I quit. I&#8217;m sure we could turn decl into a paper if we wanted.</p>
<p>Recently, I have released <a href="http://bettercodereview.org">Better Code Review</a>, which I hope solves code review in the future. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/p-oscar-boykin/2/273/9a7">Patrick Boykin</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sritchie09">Sam Ritchie</a> mentored me on decl, while they built <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/11/twitter-summingbird/">Summingbird</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/posco/status/533748929133678593">Patrick is still interested</a> in collaborating, and <a href="https://twitter.com/sritchie/status/529433269289246720">so is Sam</a>. That&#8217;s as close to peer review as I can seem to manage in Silicon Valley. </p>

<h2>Harvard</h2>
<p>I was a Ph.D. student at Harvard, avised by <a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/">Stephen Chong</a>. I focused on developing a <a href="http://mikegagnon.com/generalized-abstract-nonsense.pdf">provable defense against high-density attacks</a>. I also did a little collaboration with <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/margo/">Margo Seltzer</a> on <a href="http://mikegagnon.com/yamba.pdf">Yamaba</a>, with <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/">Michael Mitzenmacher</a> on <a href="http://mikegagnon.com/heliox.pdf">Heliox</a>, and with <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~waldo/">Jim Waldo</a>, <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~parkes/">David Parkes</a>, and <a href="http://www.filosophy.org/">Filip Zembowicz</a> on <a href="http://mikegagnon.com/barter-computing.pdf">Barter Computing</a>. We briefly considered turning Barter Computing into a startup.</p>
<p>I believe I have satisfied all the course requirements. I present this document as my dissertation. I believe all that is left to do, now, is defend it in person.</p>
</div>

<div id='attack'>
<h2>High-Density Attack</h2>
<p>High-density attacks represent an especially threatening form of denial-of-service attack, whereby each individual request consumes a disproportionate amount of resources. These attacks are especially threatening because they are especially powerful, economical, and stealthy. Furthermore, high-density attacks are on the rise.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s applications, languages, frameworks, operating systems and servers crumble when subjected to high-density attacks. Fortunately, <a href="http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/06/25/current-events/">it is easy to patch high-density vulnerabilities, even in the middle of the night, while you&#8217;re being attacked, within five minutes, as long as you&#8217;ve already engineered your system for hotpatching</a>. Furthermore, there are also a variety of engineering best practices that you can employ, now, to safely mitigate the risks associated with high-density attacks in the near future.</p>
</div>

<div id='dasient'>
<h2>Dasient</h2>
<p>Eventually, I took an official leave of absence from Harvard to join a startup in Silicon Valley called Dasient. The market forces of capitalism compelled me. Also, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/25/AR2007032500855.html">as I once told the Washington Post</a>, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think people like me will stay here if they aren&#8217;t offered as stimulating opportunities as there are elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six months in, Twitter bought us out, but before they did I found a <a href="http://mikegagnon.com/2011/07/26/hashing-imei-numbers-does-not-protect-privacy/">crypto mistake</a> that some Big Namebrands made. Also, we <a href="https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-11/Daswani/BH_US_11_Daswani_Mobile_Malware_WP.pdf">published a paper at Blackhat</a>, which reported the largest behavorial analysis of Android apps, to date.</p>

<div id='great-english'>
<h2>The Great English Professor</h2>
<p>According to Zen Legend, there was once a Great Zen Professor. In his career he collaborated with over 500 other Academics and published a countless number of Academic papers at highly respected Academic Journals. He was also quite the oddballâ€”the oddball of oddballs, or so they say.</p>
<p>Because he was so highly respected, everyone wanted to collaborate with him. Unfortunately, it was often frustrating to work with him because he only spoke in <em>koans</em>. A koan is a Zen puzzle that is (1) easy to state, (2) easy to verify the solution, (3) takes a fair amount of work to solve, and (4) is engineered to enlighten the mind of the puzzle solver.</p>
<h3>A Great English Professor Visits</h3>
<p>Because the Great Zen Professor was so highly respected, a numeral system developed to measure the distance between other Academics and the Great Zen Professor himself.</p>
<p>The Great Zen Professor had the Zen Number Zero. Everyone who collaborated with him had the Zen Number One. Everyone who collaborated with one those Academics, but who had a Zen Number less than One, had the Zen Number Two. And so on.</p>
<p>A Great English Professor was perplexed by the Great Zen Professor. How did someone who only spoke riddles manage to be so successful? He also wanted to have One for a Zen Number.</p>
<p>So, he decided to visit The Great Zen Professor.</p>
<h3>Cognac</h3>
<p>On his travels towards the Great Zen Professor, the Great English Professor passed through France, where a Great French Professor gifted him a bottle of 100-year-old Louis XIII Cognacâ€”the best cognac in the World.</p>
<h3>The Doorman</h3>
<p>The Wall Street Journal is publishing an article that prescribes how to drink 100-year old Louis XIII Cognac. They prescribe &#8220;one small drop at a time,&#8221; and The Great English Professor couldnâ€™t agree more.</p>
<p>Another question entirely is: &#8220;how to split a bottle of 100-year old Louis XIII?&#8221;</p>
<p>When the Great English Professor arrived at the Great Zen Professor&#8217;s University, he was greeted by a Doorman. The Doorman refused to let the Great English Professor see the Great Zen Professor.
So he tried to schmooze the Doorman with his bottle of Louis XIII Cognac.</p>
<p>Being a proper Doorman, he wasnâ€™t susceptible to Bribes. The Doorman responded &#8220;I cannot accept this gift.&#8221;</p>
<p>But The Great English Professor insisted. He explained that he had travelled far, and through a recent stroke of good fortune, he had stumbled upon this most rare treat. It wouldnâ€™t be proper for him to have it all for himself. He implored the Doorman to accept his gift.
The Doorman responded &#8220;I agree. How about we give this gift to the Great Zen Professor, and we can share it together?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, The Great English Professor agreed. After all, fine Cognac is meant to be shared.</p>
<h3>The Question</h3>
<p>The Doorman and the Great English Professor walked into the University and into the Great Zen Professor&#8217;s office, where they found him playing ping pong. He put his paddle down and had a seat in his chair. The Doorman gave him the bottle of Louis XIII.</p>
<p>Before even meeting the Great English Professor, the Great Zen Professor said &#8220;You may ask me one question, and one question only.&#8221;
The Great English Professor asked the Great Zen Professor: &#8220;What is your Secret? How are you so successful?&#8221;</p>
<h3>The Response</h3>
<p>The Great Zen Professor said &#8220;I will tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He invited everyone to sit, and he pulled out three empty Balloon glasses. He poured his visitorâ€™s Balloon full, and then kept on pouring, even as it overflowed.</p>
<p>The visitor screamed: &#8220;That is Louis XIII Cognac! You are wasting it!&#8221;
The Great Zen Professor stopped pouring, put the bottle down, and said: &#8220;Like this Ballon, you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your Balloon?&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>He then invited The Great English Professor to drink, and he didâ€”one small drop at a time.</p>
<p>When The Great English Professor was finished, The Great Zen Professor invited him to come back once he had (1) solved the koan, and (2) acquired a Zen Number of Two.</p>
<h3>The Bouncer</h3>
<p>The Great English Professor began to protest: &#8220;But I have traveled all this way!&#8221;</p>
<p>A Bouncer, standing nearby, stood with his arms crossed, and said softly &#8220;You need to leave now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Great English Professor assessed the situation, then intelligently left.</p>
<p>Then the Bouncer, the Doorman, and The Great Zen Professor all enjoyed the rest of the bottle of Louis XIII Cognac, and everyone went back to work.</p>

<div id='hellasec'>
<h2>HellaSec, LLC</h2>
<p>While working at Twitter, I continued researching high-density attack and defense through a DARPA side project. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peiter_Zatko">Mudge</a> oversaw <a href="javascript:Sidenote.openColumnLoud('#hellasec','#beer-garden','Beer Garden')">Beer Garden</a>, which I developed with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivbalepin">Ivan Balepin</a>. Since I attacked Wikipedia in the project, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9gEH-EqNFo">I presented Beer Garden&#8217;s defense at Wikipedia</a>. I was also invited to defend Beer Garden at the Pentagon, but I was busy studying Tibetan Buddhism at <a href="http://www.shambhalamountain.org/">Shambhala Mountain Center</a> at the time.</p>
<p>After I quit Twitter, Ivan scooped me up to consult for <a href="http://www.riskiq.com/">RiskIQ</a>, where I led the development of a novel big-data framework. I bet they would give me a copy of my final report, with a stamp that says &#8220;Propreitary&#8221; on top.</p>
<p>After that, I quit HellaSec and took about a year off from work.</p>

<p>Once, while a student at Harvard, I had to take a few days away from class to present my defense to Generals in the Pentagon, while I blacked out a radar that was previously showing us the location of an actual ICBM that was flying somewhere over the Earth at the time. I explained how I blacked out the radar, and how I brought it back online.
