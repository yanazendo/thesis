~harvard
## Harvard

I was a Ph.D. student at Harvard, avised by [Stephen Chong](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/). I focused on developing a [provable defense against high-density attacks](http://mikegagnon.com/generalized-abstract-nonsense.pdf). I also did a little collaboration with [Margo Seltzer](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/margo/) on [Yamaba](http://mikegagnon.com/yamba.pdf), with [Michael Mitzenmacher](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/) on [Heliox](http://mikegagnon.com/heliox.pdf), and with [Jim Waldo](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~waldo/), [David Parkes](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~parkes/), and [Filip Zembowicz](http://www.filosophy.org/) on [Barter Computing](http://mikegagnon.com/barter-computing.pdf). We briefly considered turning Barter Computing into a startup.

I believe I have satisfied all the course requirements. I present this document as my Ph.D. Thesis. I believe all that is left to do, now, is defend it in person.

~mit
## MIT Lincoln Laboratory

Once, while a student at Harvard, I had to take a few days away from class to present my defense to Generals in the Pentagon, while I blacked out a radar that was previously showing us the location of an actual ICBM that was flying somewhere over the Earth at the time. I explained how I blacked out the radar, and how I brought it back online. This project was honored as [one of MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Principal Accomplishments](##key-accomplishment) for that year. I presented [the results](http://mikegagnon.com/radar-blackout.pdf) in Prague.

~key-accomplishment
## Principal Accomplishment

[MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Annual Report for 2010](http://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/Annual_Report_2010.pdf) lists the radar-blackout exercise as the first Principal Accomplishment for the Communication Systems Division on page 20.

~dasient
## Dasient

Eventually, I took an official leave of absence from Harvard to join a startup in Silicon Valley called Dasient. The market forces of capitalism compelled me. Also, [as I once told the Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/25/AR2007032500855.html), "I don't think people like me will stay here if they aren't offered as stimulating opportunities as there are elsewhere."

Six months in, Twitter bought us out, but before they did I found a [crypto mistake](http://mikegagnon.com/2011/07/26/hashing-imei-numbers-does-not-protect-privacy/) that some Big Namebrands made. Also, we [published a paper at Blackhat](https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-11/Daswani/BH_US_11_Daswani_Mobile_Malware_WP.pdf), which reported the largest behavorial analysis of Android apps, to date.

~twitter
## Twitter

At Twitter, I worked on the Revenue Risk Team, where we were re-tasked every six months to work on the lastest revenue threat.

There, I wrote [decl](https://github.com/mikegagnon/decl), a declarative programming language that compiled down to [Scalding](https://github.com/twitter/scalding), which made it very easy for me to express and compute the big-data questions I wanted to answer. I used decl on several projects, but the code was "too sophisticated" to review. So, I quit. I'm sure we could turn decl into a paper if we wanted.

Recently, I have released [Better Code Review](http://bettercodereview.org), which I hope solves code review in the future. [Patrick Boykin](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/p-oscar-boykin/2/273/9a7) and [Sam Ritchie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sritchie09) mentored me on decl, while they built [Summingbird](http://www.wired.com/2013/11/twitter-summingbird/). [Patrick is still interested](https://twitter.com/posco/status/533748929133678593) in collaborating, and [so is Sam](https://twitter.com/sritchie/status/529433269289246720). That's as close to peer review as I can seem to manage in Silicon Valley. 

~hellasec
## HellaSec, LLC

While working at Twitter, I continued researching high-density attack and defense through a DARPA side project. [Mudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peiter_Zatko) oversaw [Beer Garden](##beer-garden), which I developed with [Ivan Balepin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivbalepin). Since I attacked Wikipedia in the project, [I presented Beer Garden's defense at Wikipedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9gEH-EqNFo). I was also invited to defend Beer Garden at the Pentagon, but I was busy studying Tibetan Buddhism at [Shambhala Mountain Center](http://www.shambhalamountain.org/) at the time.

After I quit Twitter, Ivan scooped me up to consult for [RiskIQ](http://www.riskiq.com/), where I led the development of a novel big-data framework. I bet they would give me a copy of my final report, with a stamp that says "Propreitary" on top.

After that, I quit HellaSec and took about a year off from work.

~apology
## Apology

I sincerely apologize for presenting such an unconventional Ph.D. thesis. However, this presentation is mutually beneficial because I have engineered it to waste very little of our time. This Ph.D. thesis is therefore engineered using the principles of [mechanism design](https://medium.com/@yanazendo/enlightened-capitalism-c366cb928a68) and [Beer Garden](##beer-garden).

Also, I claim [Sidenote](http://sidenote.io) is great for presenting encyclopedic information, so I feel obligated to use Sidenote as well.

~proposal
## Proposal

I propose we use the [Great Zen Professor](https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-great-zen-professor-71c9ce7cf58d) algorithm to evaluate this Ph.D. thesis.

Essentially, we should all be very lazy. If someone finds this thesis interesting, that person should find someone else who finds this thesis more interesting, and ask for his or her opinion. Grad students come to mind.

~now
## Now

I am using the [Great Investment Banker](https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-bodhisattva-investment-banker-9a23b19f148f) algorithm to lead several businesses simultaneously. My currently flahship business is [House of Gita](http://houseofgita.com), but I am also planning to work with the Department of Defense again.

I also have a number of side projects in the works.

~attack
## High-Density Attack

High-density attacks represent an especially threatening form of denial-of-service attack, whereby each individual request consumes a disproportionate amount of resources. These attacks are especially threatening because they are especially powerful, economical, and stealthy. Furthermore, high-density attacks are on the rise.

Today's applications, languages, frameworks, operating systems and servers crumble when subjected to high-density attacks. Fortunately, [it is easy to patch high-density vulnerabilities, even in the middle of the night, while you're being attacked, within five minutes, as long as you've already engineered your system for hotpatching](http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/06/25/current-events/). Furthermore, there are also a variety of engineering best practices that you can employ, now, to safely mitigate the risks associated with high-density attacks in the near future.

~defense
## High-Density Defense

It is easy to defend against high-density attacks. There are a variety of excellent techniques. In my personal life, I prefer [Beer Garden](##beer-garden).

The greatest discovery of my research is that the Beer Garden defense is equivalent to [Zen](https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-great-zen-professor-71c9ce7cf58d) and [Jiu Jitsu](https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-legendary-jiu-jitsu-master-53d611ef3004).

I hypothesize that the Beer Garden defense can be used to [make lots of money while improving the world](https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-bodhisattva-investment-banker-9a23b19f148f). I am testing this hypothesis now.

This thesis represents a high-density defense.

~beer-garden
## Beer Garden

Beer Garden defends against high-density attacks by using (1) a *Bouncer* to kick out frivolous requests, and (2) a *Doorman* to invert work requests.
