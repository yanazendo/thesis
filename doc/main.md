~harvard
## Harvard

I was a Ph.D. student at Harvard, avised by [Stephen Chong](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/). I focused on developing a [provable defense against high-density attacks](http://mikegagnon.com/generalized-abstract-nonsense.pdf). I also did a little collaboration with [Margo Seltzer](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/margo/) on [Yamaba](http://mikegagnon.com/yamba.pdf), with [Michael Mitzenmacher](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/) on [Heliox](http://mikegagnon.com/heliox.pdf), and with [Jim Waldo](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~waldo/), [David Parkes](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~parkes/), and [Filip Zembowicz](http://www.filosophy.org/) on [Barter Computing](http://mikegagnon.com/barter-computing.pdf). We briefly considered turning Barter Computing into a startup.

I believe I have satisfied all the course requirements. I present this document as my Ph.D. Thesis. I believe all that is left to do, now, is defend it in person.

~mit
## MIT Lincoln Laboratory

Once, while a student at Harvard, I had to take a few days away from class to present my defense to Generals in the Pentagon, while I blacked out a radar that was previously showing us the location of an actual ICBM that was flying somewhere over the Earth at the time. I explained how I blacked out the radar, and how I brought it back online. This project was honored as [one of MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Principal Accomplishments](##key-accomplishment) for that year. I presented [the results](http://mikegagnon.com/radar-blackout.pdf) in Prague.

~key-accomplishment
## Principal Accomplishment

[MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Annual Report for 2010](http://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/Annual_Report_2010.pdf) lists the radar-blackout exercise as the first Principal Accomplishment for the Communication Systems Division on page 20.

~dasient
## Dasient

Eventually, I took an official leave of absence from Harvard to join a startup in Silicon Valley called Dasient. The market forces of capitalism compelled me. Also, [as I once told the Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/25/AR2007032500855.html), "I don't think people like me will stay here if they aren't offered as stimulating opportunities as there are elsewhere."

Six months in, Twitter bought us out, but before they did I found a [crypto mistake](http://mikegagnon.com/2011/07/26/hashing-imei-numbers-does-not-protect-privacy/) that some Big Namebrands made. Also, we [published a paper at Blackhat](https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-11/Daswani/BH_US_11_Daswani_Mobile_Malware_WP.pdf), which reported the largest behavorial analysis of Android apps, to date.

~twitter
## Twitter

At Twitter, I worked on the Revenue Risk Team, where we were re-tasked every six months to work on the lastest revenue threat.

There, I wrote [decl](https://github.com/mikegagnon/decl), a declarative programming language that compiled down to [Scalding](https://github.com/twitter/scalding), which made it very easy for me to express and compute the big-data questions I wanted to answer. I used decl on several projects, but the code was "too sophisticated" to review. So, I quit. I'm sure we could turn decl into a paper if we wanted.

Recently, I have released [Better Code Review](http://bettercodereview.org), which I hope solves code review in the future. [Patrick Boykin](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/p-oscar-boykin/2/273/9a7) and [Sam Ritchie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sritchie09) mentored me on decl, while they built [Summingbird](http://www.wired.com/2013/11/twitter-summingbird/). [Patrick is still interested](https://twitter.com/posco/status/533748929133678593) in collaborating, and [so is Sam](https://twitter.com/sritchie/status/529433269289246720). That's as close to peer review as I can seem to manage in Silicon Valley. 

~hellasec
## HellaSec, LLC

While working at Twitter, I continued researching high-density attack and defense through a DARPA side project. [Mudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peiter_Zatko) oversaw [Beer Garden](##beer-garden), which I developed with [Ivan Balepin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivbalepin). Since I attacked Wikipedia in the project, [I presented Beer Garden's defense at Wikipedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9gEH-EqNFo). I was also invited to defend Beer Garden at the Pentagon, but I was busy studying Tibetan Buddhism at [Shambhala Mountain Center](http://www.shambhalamountain.org/) at the time.

After I quit Twitter, Ivan scooped me up to consult for [RiskIQ](http://www.riskiq.com/), where I led the development of a novel big-data framework. I bet they would give me a copy of my final report, with a stamp that says "Propreitary" on top.

After that, I quit HellaSec and took about a year off from work.

~apology
## Apology

I sincerely apologize for presenting such an unconventional Ph.D. thesis. However, this presentation is mutually beneficial because I have engineered it to waste very little of our time. This Ph.D. thesis is therefore engineered using the principles of [mechanism design](https://medium.com/@yanazendo/enlightened-capitalism-c366cb928a68) and [Beer Garden](##beer-garden).

Also, I claim [Sidenote](http://sidenote.io) is great for presenting encyclopedic information, so I feel obligated to use Sidenote as well.

~proposal
## Proposal

I propose we use the [Great Zen Professor](https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-great-zen-professor-71c9ce7cf58d) algorithm to evaluate this Ph.D. thesis.

Essentially, we should all be very lazy. If someone finds this thesis interesting, that person should find someone else who finds this thesis more interesting, and ask for his or her opinion. Grad students come to mind.

~now
## Now

I am using the [Great Investment Banker](https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-bodhisattva-investment-banker-9a23b19f148f) algorithm to lead several businesses simultaneously. My currently flahship business is [House of Gita](http://houseofgita.com), but I am also planning to work with the Department of Defense again.

I also have a number of side projects in the works.

~attack
## High-Density Attack

High-density attacks represent an especially threatening form of denial-of-service attack, whereby each individual request consumes a disproportionate amount of resources. These attacks are especially threatening because they are especially powerful, economical, and stealthy. Furthermore, high-density attacks are on the rise.

Today's applications, languages, frameworks, operating systems and servers crumble when subjected to high-density attacks. Fortunately, [it is easy to patch high-density vulnerabilities, even in the middle of the night, while you're being attacked, within five minutes, as long as you've already engineered your system for hotpatching](http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/06/25/current-events/). Furthermore, there are also a variety of engineering best practices that you can employ, now, to safely mitigate the risks associated with high-density attacks in the near future.

~defense
## High-Density Defense

It is easy to defend against high-density attacks. There are a variety of excellent techniques. In my personal life, I prefer [Beer Garden](##beer-garden).

The greatest discovery of my research is that the Beer Garden defense is equivalent to [Zen](https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-great-zen-professor-71c9ce7cf58d) and [Jiu Jitsu](https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-legendary-jiu-jitsu-master-53d611ef3004).

I hypothesize that the Beer Garden defense can be used to [make lots of money while improving the world](https://medium.com/@yanazendo/the-bodhisattva-investment-banker-9a23b19f148f). I am testing this hypothesis now.

This thesis represents a high-density defense.

~beer-garden
## Beer Garden

Beer Garden defends against high-density attacks by using (1) a *Bouncer* to kick out frivolous requests, and (2) a *Doorman* to invert work requests.

Beer Garden is most entertainingly explained through the story of [the Great English Professor](##great-english).

## The Great English Professor

According to Zen Legend, there was once a Great Zen Professor. In his career he collaborated with over 500 other Academics and published a countless number of Academic papers at highly respected Academic Journals. He was also quite the oddball—the oddball of oddballs, or so they say.

Because he was so highly respected, everyone wanted to collaborate with him. Unfortunately, it was often frustrating to work with him because he only spoke in *koans*. A koan is a Zen puzzle that is (1) easy to state, (2) easy to verify the solution, (3) takes a fair amount of work to solve, and (4) is engineered to enlighten the mind of the puzzle solver.

### A Great English Professor Visits

Because the Great Zen Professor was so highly respected, a numeral system developed to measure the distance between other Academics and the Great Zen Professor himself.

The Great Zen Professor had the Zen Number Zero. Everyone who collaborated with him had the Zen Number One. Everyone who collaborated with one those Academics, but who had a Zen Number less than One, had the Zen Number Two. And so on.

A Great English Professor was perplexed by the Great Zen Professor. How did someone who only spoke riddles manage to be so successful? He also wanted to have One for a Zen Number.

So, he decided to visit The Great Zen Professor.

### Cognac

On his travels towards the Great Zen Professor, the Great English Professor passed through France, where a Great French Professor gifted him a bottle of 100-year-old Louis XIII Cognac—the best cognac in the World.

### The Doorman

The Wall Street Journal is publishing an article that prescribes how to drink 100-year old Louis XIII Cognac. They prescribe "one small drop at a time," and The Great English Professor couldn’t agree more.

Another question entirely is: "how to split a bottle of 100-year old Louis XIII?"

When the Great English Professor arrived at the Great Zen Professor's University, he was greeted by a Doorman. The Doorman refused to let the Great English Professor see the Great Zen Professor.
So he tried to schmooze the Doorman with his bottle of Louis XIII Cognac.

Being a proper Doorman, he wasn’t susceptible to Bribes. The Doorman responded "I cannot accept this gift."

But The Great English Professor insisted. He explained that he had travelled far, and through a recent stroke of good fortune, he had stumbled upon this most rare treat. It wouldn’t be proper for him to have it all for himself. He implored the Doorman to accept his gift.
The Doorman responded "I agree. How about we give this gift to the Great Zen Professor, and we can share it together?"

Of course, The Great English Professor agreed. After all, fine Cognac is meant to be shared.

### The Question

The Doorman and the Great English Professor walked into the University and into the Great Zen Professor's office, where they found him playing ping pong. He put his paddle down and had a seat in his chair. The Doorman gave him the bottle of Louis XIII.

Before even meeting the Great English Professor, the Great Zen Professor said "You may ask me one question, and one question only."
The Great English Professor asked the Great Zen Professor: "What is your Secret? How are you so successful?"

### The Response

The Great Zen Professor said "I will tell you."

He invited everyone to sit, and he pulled out three empty Balloon glasses. He poured his visitor’s Balloon full, and then kept on pouring, even as it overflowed.

The visitor screamed: "That is Louis XIII Cognac! You are wasting it!"
The Great Zen Professor stopped pouring, put the bottle down, and said: "Like this Ballon, you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your Balloon?""

He then invited The Great English Professor to drink, and he did—one small drop at a time.

When The Great English Professor was finished, The Great Zen Professor invited him to come back once he had (1) solved the koan, and (2) acquired a Zen Number of Two.

### The Bouncer

The Great English Professor began to protest: "But I have traveled all this way!"

A Bouncer, standing nearby, stood with his arms crossed, and said softly "You need to leave now."

The Great English Professor assessed the situation, then intelligently left.

Then the Bouncer, the Doorman, and The Great Zen Professor all enjoyed the rest of the bottle of Louis XIII Cognac, and everyone went back to work.
